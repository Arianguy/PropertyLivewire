# Property Sale Implementation Guide

This document outlines the complete implementation of the property sale functionality in the PropertyLivewire system, ensuring transaction record preservation and proper archiving.

## Overview

The property sale system allows authorized users to:
- Mark properties as sold with complete sale details
- Automatically archive sold properties
- Preserve all historical transaction records
- Close active contracts automatically
- Maintain comprehensive audit trails

## Implementation Components

### 1. Database Schema Updates

#### Migration: `2024_12_19_000000_add_sale_fields_to_properties_table.php`
Adds the following fields to the `properties` table:
- `sale_date` (date, nullable) - Date when the property was sold
- `sale_price` (decimal 15,2, nullable) - Final sale price
- `buyer_name` (string, nullable) - Name of the buyer
- `sale_notes` (text, nullable) - Additional notes about the sale
- `is_archived` (boolean, default false) - Archive status flag
- `archived_at` (timestamp, nullable) - When the property was archived
- `archived_by` (foreign key to users, nullable) - User who archived the property

### 2. Model Updates

#### Property Model Enhancements
- **New Fillable Fields**: Added all sale-related fields to mass assignment
- **New Casts**: Proper type casting for dates and decimals
- **New Relationship**: `archivedBy()` - Links to the user who archived the property
- **New Scopes**: 
  - `active()` - Returns non-archived properties
  - `archived()` - Returns archived properties

### 3. Status Management

#### Updated Property Statuses
The system now supports these property statuses:
- `VACANT` - Property is available for rent
- `LEASED` - Property is currently rented
- `MAINTENANCE` - Property is under maintenance
- `SOLD` - Property has been sold and archived

#### Validation Updates
- Updated `Properties\Create` component validation

    ->name('properties.show');
